## How to access the functions in the R shell

- Go to top level directory.
- Run R in your console.
- Run `install.packages("devtools")`
- Run `devtools::load_add()`

Now you have loaded all functions into the R shell. They can be found under the
regrtest namespace. Just tabcomplete on regrtest:: and you can see available functions.
Check the source for params.
